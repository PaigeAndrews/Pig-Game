### Pig Game Rules
___
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

* If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the computer's turn.
* If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their round score and the player's turn continues.
* If a player chooses to "hold", their round score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to get a total score 100 or more points wins!
**Whomever's turn is active, thier eyes will glow red**
